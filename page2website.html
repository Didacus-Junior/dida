<h2>About us</h2>
<p center >Yuri-Group Foundation is a self-initiative program started with the aim of looking for better ways to improve the lives of children and adults in marginalized areas by providing basic literacy education such as; reading, writing, arithmetic and essential ICT teaching. 
The foundation has also been brought to life to also greatly focus on researching on the role played by poverty on reducing the literacy rate in the area in order to find sustainable solutions which help in eradicating amongst the factors lowering the levels of literacy in the specific communities.
Taking into consideration that the foundation is newly found, we rely on well-wishers and volunteers on being able to provide the sufficient and efficient help to these marginalized communities.<br></p>

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM.</br>

 <p>Tanzania being amongst the developing nations of the world a significant number of its population still resides in rural areas where there is a scarcity of amenities which can help the communities develop independently. One of these is the shortage of skilled individuals who can pass knowledge to the residences of these communities and also receiving minimal support from their local governments and the outside world because of factors such as equitable distribution of resources, these communities usually end up having even less than what can sustain to build their communities. 
In addition, children and youth in these communities have been brought up on certain tradition that have not given them the awareness on how formal education can open many doors of opportunity to them and their communities in general. This could be easily eradicated and find a way to give a positive mentality to the children and youth to desire to learn, improve their creativity and also heighten their ambitions in life.</center>
